==============================

This code was written as an assignment for The Odin Project's Web Development 101 course. The objective was to create a mock-up of Google's homepage as practice for HTML and CSS, by creating a web page that looks as close to the real thing as possible, including all visible elements and stylings. The page is not intended to have complete functionality.
